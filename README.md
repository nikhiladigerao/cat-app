## How to use
Install Docker onto your computer. The _getting started guide_ on Docker has detailed instructions for setting up Docker on [Mac, Linux, and Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

Once docker is installed, you may run the following command in your terminal:

`docker run -p 8888:5000 nikhiladigerao/catnip`

and enter in `localhost:8888/` into your browser of choice.
